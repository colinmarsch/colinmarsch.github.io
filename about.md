title: About Me
---

I'm an Android engineer working at [Square](https://squareup.com) on [Cash App](https://cash.app). I recently graduated from Computer Science at [UWaterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca).
Over the course of my undergrad, I had the opportunity to intern at [CIBC](https://www.cibc.com/en/about-cibc/careers/teams/digital.html), [SAP](https://www.sap.com), [Google](https://google.com) and three times at [Square](https://squareup.com).

In my free time, I like to travel and explore the world (pre-covid, that is), read and [take pictures](https://www.instagram.com/marschcolin/). As well, I am always practicing to make the perfect cup of coffee.
