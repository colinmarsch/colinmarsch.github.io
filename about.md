title: About Me
---

I'm a fourth year Computer Science student at [UWaterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca) who's had the opportunity to intern at [CIBC](https://www.cibc.com/en/about-cibc/careers/teams/digital.html), [SAP](https://www.sap.com), [Google](https://google.com) and three times at [Square](https://squareup.com).

This fall I am interning at [Square](https://squareup.com) working on [Cash App](https://cash.app/).

Through these internships I have built a passion for Android development. I hope to be able to further my skills and build impactful products to improve people's lives.

In my free time, I like to travel and explore the world (pre-covid, that is), read and take pictures. As well, I am always practicing to make the perfect cup of coffee.
