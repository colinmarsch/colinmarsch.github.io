title: About Me
---

Iâ€™m an Android engineer working at [Block](https://block.xyz/) on [Cash App](https://cash.app/). I graduated from Computer Science at [UWaterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/) in 2021.
Over the course of my undergrad, I had the opportunity to intern at [CIBC](https://www.cibc.com/en/about-cibc/careers/teams/digital.html), 
[SAP](https://www.sap.com/), [Google](https://google.com/) and three times at [Square](https://squareup.com/) (now [Block](https://block.xyz/)).

In my free time, I like to travel and explore the world, [read](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/109611990-colin) and [take pictures](https://instagram.com/marschcolin/).
As well, I'm always practicing to make the perfect cup of coffee.
