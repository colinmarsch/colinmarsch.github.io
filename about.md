title: About Me
---

I'm a fourth year Computer Science student at [UWaterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca) who's had the opportunity to intern at [CIBC](https://www.cibc.com/en/about-cibc/careers/teams/digital.html), [SAP](https://www.sap.com), twice at [Square](https://squareup.com) and most recently [Google](https://google.com).

This fall I will be returning to [Square](https://squareup.com) to work on [Cash App](https://cash.app/).

Through these internships I have built a passion for Android development. I hope to be able to further my skills and build impactful products to improve people's lives.

In my free time, I like to travel and explore the world (pre-covid, that is), read and take pictures. As well, I am always practicing to make the perfect cup of coffee.
