title: Thoughts on Finding an Early Career Niche
tags: android internship new-grad career
---
Of the six internships that I completed during my undergrad, five were focused on Android 
development. When I was starting university and thinking about what I would like to work 
on during my internships, I had planned to try out different tech stacks to get a feel for 
what I enjoyed working with the most, as that was the advice I had often heard from upper year 
students and people working in the industry. Once I discovered my strong interest in Android 
development however, contrary to popular advice, I changed paths to direct my 
focus there and it's a decision that I haven't regretted since. In this blog post I want to 
share some of the unique benefits I've found that finding a niche in software engineering
early on gave me in my career.

### Depth Can Help Breadth
After getting more deep Android experience I realized that developing depth in one area can 
offer a good opportunity to expand the breadth
of your knowledge to adjacent skills. While there are a large range of technical skills that 
span over tech stacks (Git, command line, SQL, etc.), the main 
breadth benefit I experienced was in non-technical skills, so-called soft skills, such as communication.

One of the things that I wanted to especially focus on improving during my internships (and 
still continuing to improve!) was my technical communication. I wanted
to be better able to communicate technical challenges I was facing and offer ideas I had more
clearly to my teammates. Focusing on Android development helped
me a lot in this area as I was able to build up my knowledge and courage to become more 
comfortable asking questions and speaking up in meetings. I 
found that when I was just starting out in an area, I found it much harder to figure out what 
questions I even have, much less figure out how to clearly communicate them to others. Having 
more depth of experience in Android development has allowed me to ask deeper questions
and learn the reasons behind some technical decisions that I don't think I would have been able 
to understand (or even have the courage to ask about) had I been less familiar with the 
technology I was working with. 

### Taking on Bigger Projects
Another benefit I found from focusing on Android development was that I was able to take on 
bigger and less well-defined projects due to having a better understanding of some of the 
complexities that go into developing for Android. From this I was able to gain experience 
working on projects with larger impact and learn more about the engineering design process 
earlier on in my career. One example of this was having the opportunity to work on integrating 
in-app review prompts into Cash App during my internship. This was a highly impactful and 
visible feature that exposed me to many things I hadn't worked with before like external SDK 
integrations and the testing and reliability complexities that can create.

The larger scope that these projects came with resulted in many benefits from diving deeper 
into the technical details of internal frameworks to meeting new people outside of my team and
expanding my network. Without a strong foundation in Android development, I believe I would have 
had a much harder time being able to keep up in these larger projects and deliver the same level 
of impact that I was able to achieve in the length of an internship.

### Thoughts For The Future
While everyone follows different paths in their careers, that can all lead to wonderful places, 
this is the one that worked out for me. I'm really enjoying the current work I'm doing in the Android 
space and could see myself continuing it for the foreseeable future. Of course, there is a part of me 
that leans towards trying out something new, when the timing is right. Thankfully, there is ample time 
try it all, whatever that may be.
